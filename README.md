📚 Background
As the competition for job placements increases, understanding the factors that contribute to student success is essential. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to identify trends and predict outcomes based on data collected from previous students.

🗃️ Data Description
The dataset includes various features such as:

CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average of students
Age: Age demographic of students
Gender: Gender classification
Stream: Educational stream (e.g., Science, Commerce)
Internship: Intern experience (Yes/No)
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and is stored in the data folder of this repository.

🌈 Key Features
Data Visualization: Visual insights into student data distributions.
Predictive Analysis: Use machine learning models to make informed predictions.
Interactive Interface: Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook for input and results.

🛠️ Modeling Techniques
This project implements several machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression: For binary classification.
Random Forest: To enhance prediction accuracy.
Support Vector Machines: For effective classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors: To determine the most similar instances.
📈 Performance Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Correct positive predictions relative to total predicted positives.
Recall: Correct positive predictions relative to actual positives.
Visualizations will illustrate the results for better understanding.
